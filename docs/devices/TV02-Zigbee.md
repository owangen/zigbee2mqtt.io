## Notes

### Pairing

1. Pull the cover in the direction out from the radiator
2. Insert 2x AA batteries. Manual says alkaline ones should last for 1,5years. When replacing old batteries, it os recommended to wait approx 1 minute before inserting new ones.
3. Ins will appear on the display - motor is travelling back - to allow easy installation (Ins + rotating n is shown). After few seconds Ada is shown.
4. Install the thermostat on radiator valve - display whould be on top side.
5. Insert the cover back to thermostat - Push and Pull symbols should match.
6. Shortly press the big round button - adaptation to the valve will start (Ada + rotating n is shown).
7. To pair - long-press the main big rotating button. Make sure the thermostat has a good signal from ZigBee coordinator.
8. There is a hidden reset button under the cover, in case of repairing or other issues press it for 5 seconds.
